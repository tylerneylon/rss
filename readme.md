# rss.py

*A simple tool to create and maintain rss feed files; an rss writer.*

This tool is meant to be used by folks who like bare-bones tools that do just
what is needed. I've designed it to create an RSS feed for my homepage.

## Installing

    git clone https://github.com/tylerneylon/rss.git
    sudo ln -s $(cd rss; pwd)/rss.py /usr/local/bin/rss

After this, you should be able to use the tool via the command `rss`.
This assumes that `/usr/local/bin` is in your path; it typically is.
